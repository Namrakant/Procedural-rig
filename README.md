# Procedural-rig
Procedurally rigging a biped character

**Introduction**:
This project started with the idea to learn how to rig a biped character procedurally. I followed the tutorial https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/procedural-rigging-python-maya-2283/table-of-contents and then I started adding my code on top of it such as for FK/IK switch for hand, legs and fingers. 

Please follow the steps in the file - "Steps to run the script" where I have documented how to run this script in your Windows operating system.
You will need the base rig I made to try this code.
